        },
        "howBook": {
          "question": "How do I book a ride?",
          "answer": "Go to the 'Find a Ride' page, select your departure city and destination. Choose from available drivers based on schedules and prices that suit you. Proceed to payment via our secure platform and you'll receive a confirmation code and ride details by SMS and in the app."
        },
        "verificationCode": {
          "question": "How does the verification code system work?",
          "answer": "After making your payment, you receive a unique 6-digit code by SMS and in the app. This code should only be presented to the driver when you're ready to begin your journey. The driver enters this code in their app, which confirms your presence and authorizes payment release. Without this code, the driver does not receive payment."
        },
        "offline": {
          "question": "What happens if I lose internet connection?",
          "answer": "PikDrive works even with limited internet connection. Your verification code is sent by SMS and can be presented offline. Drivers can also validate codes offline, and synchronization will occur automatically once connection is restored."
        },
        "driverCancel": {
          "question": "What happens if my driver cancels?",
          "answer": "If your driver cancels, you'll be notified immediately by SMS and notification in the app. You can then either choose another available driver (we'll suggest alternatives), or request a full refund which will be processed within 24 hours to your original payment method."
        },
        "becomeDriver": {
          "question": "How do I become a driver?",
          "answer": "Visit our 'Become a Driver' page to start the process. You'll need to provide: a valid ID, your driver's license, vehicle documents (registration card, insurance, technical inspection), and a professional photo. Our teams verify these documents and organize a quick training on using the app. The process usually takes 48-72 hours."
        },
        "paymentSecure": {
          "question": "Is my payment secure?",
          "answer": "Yes, we use international standard encryption for all transactions. Payments are secured by our verification code system: money is only released to the driver after your code validation, ensuring you receive the booked service. If you have any issues, our support team is available 24/7."
